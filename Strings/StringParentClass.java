     * String are of 3 types:
     * 1. String (immutable, thread safe as new object is created for every change)
     * 2. StringBuffer (mutable, thread safe)
     * 3. StringBuilder (mutable, thread unsafe)
     * 
     * 
     * For String type, literal pool optimizes memory by avoiding reallocating
     * memory to already existing string and instead new object also points to same
     * memory literal
